# daedalus
A game about a labyrinth in x86 assembly

In private repo because this is only to manage versions and be able to make changes fearlessly. 
Maybe I'll make it public after the course is done. 

# Running

This only runs on x86. You can compile it with gcc:

```bash
gcc src/daedalus.s -no-pie -o daedalus && ./daedalus
```

# Spec

Spec is in [[spec.md]]
