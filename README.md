A game about a labyrinth in x86 assembly

In private repo because this is only to manage versions and colaborate. 
Maybe I'll make it public after the course is done. 

## Running

This only runs on Linux x86-64. It uses make and GCC. 

If you have linux, just run

```bash
make
```

### Other platforms

**Windows**: 
1. Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Run `sudo apt-get gcc` and `sudo apt-get make`
3. Run `make` on the directory

**MacOS**: This is harder, especially on M1 macs. I used Lima, but maybe Docker can work too. But I can't be bothered to write step by step instructions so you're on your own lol


## More info

There is a specification available at [[Spec.md]]
